            <p class="work-text">
              We employed a range of state-of-the art gutter cleaning and vacuuming systems, to clean, unblock and restore these gutters to a clean and free-flowing state. <br>
              Around ventilation covers, we used gentle brushes and the minimum water pressure required to avoid water ingress. Our aim was to leave the soffits, gutters and downpipes spotless.<br>
              Through time their gutters, fascia board and soffit had accumulated dirt, grime, mildew and algae, due to airborne pollution. Gutters and downpipes became blocked internally with leaves, moss and other detritus. Their external gutters, downpipes, fascia board and soffits became soiled with unsightly deposits.

              To achieve safe and effective cleaning results on this project, we did a pre-treatment of Power-Wash Cleaner and Pro-Moss Cleaner (which are specialised industry certified cleaning solutions) on their roof to break down years of grime like algae, lichens and moss. We then used our professionally designed cleaning tools to rinse the surfaces without the use of high pressure.<br>

            <p class="work-text"> 
              Upon inspection of the walls our operators decided that a soft wash was the best method on removing organic growth on the walls. Afterwhich, a brush was used to appy a biocide. This works immediately to remove all organic growth present. The surface is then left to shed the dead bio-film for 4-6 weeks and the walls look like new again.

            <p class="work-text">
              Overgrown hedges in your garden or commercial premises can cause a variety of problems and due to new high hedge legislation, can even see you fined if you don't take care of the problem. This project involved our professional hedge cutting specialists to trim and shape the hedges, weed-control and a tidy-up at the end of the project.

          <p class="work-text"> 
            Indian Sandstone is a very hardwearing material, but one of the biggest problems we find with stone flooring outside is, it soon becomes stained by the elements.<br>
            We treated the area first with a medium dilution of our Pro-clean solution to break down the soil. This was then scrubbed in using a rotary machine and stiff buffing brush. This was followed by pressure washing and rinsing the area with water.
